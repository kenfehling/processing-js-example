# processing-js-example

Shows a Processing sketch running in a web page

The steps I took to create it:

1. Create a project using Processing and save as a .pde file.
2. Download the processing.js library.
3. Create an HTML page including the processing.js lib.
4. Add a canvas to the page that references the .pde file using the `data-processing-sources` attribute.
